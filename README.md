# Urban_Sound_Classification
Classification of urban sounds using spectrogram representations

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how a simple neural network made in Keras, together with some helpful audio analysis libraries, can distinguish between 10 different sounds with high accuracy, using the UrbanSound dataset available on Kaggle.
